# Embedded_Systems_Project
C Code written for a IoT-Enabled / Autonomous Vehicle 

The project was to create a small vehicle that ran off of an MSP 430 microcontroller.  The vehicle needed to follow a black line on the ground without any user interaction.  It also needed to incorporate a manual control mode, which was accomplished with a Wi-Fi module.
